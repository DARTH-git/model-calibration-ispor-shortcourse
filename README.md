# ISPOR Short Course on Model Calibration in R

Material for ISPOR's 2023 Short Course on Model Calibration in R

In preparation for the workshop, participants should complete the following steps:

1. Download and install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) if you do not already have them installed on your computer. Both of these resources are free.
2. Download this repository as a .zip file and unzip it to a working directory (where they will complete the workshop exercises).
3. Open the "ISPOR Calibration Participant Materials" folder and double-click the R project "Calibration.Rproj". This should open an Rstudio window with the working directory set to the participant materials folder.
4. In RStudio, open the R script "00_prep.R" and run the script. This script installs the R packages necessary for the workshop. IMPORTANT: If you encounter errors when running the "00_prep.R" script, please attempt to resolve them based on the error messages provided (e.g. by installing or updating packages, checking permissions in the folder they are working in, updating their version of R or Rstudio, etc.). There will be a limited amount of time to resolve R software issues during the workshop.
